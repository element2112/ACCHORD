# Product Vision

Acchord is for musicians of all experience levels and is suitable to craft a playlist for any user’s groove. Our app’s main focus is to give musicians the ability to practice instrumental improvisation, match their key preferences to friends with a similar sound profile, or for the average music lover to immerse themselves  within their favorite chord progressions. Acchord leads to enhanced “smart” playlist creation with a user-friendly interface that connects directly to your Spotify account. Acchord can also inform songwriters of how a chord progression is most often used and makes creativity simple by demonstrating examples in popular songs across all genres. This app will be the first of its kind, creating an environment for music lovers to be introduced to songs with familiar and exotic chords and key signatures.  Unlike other apps that focus on the structured theory of chords and how to form them, Acchord hopes to aid users in understanding the musical world and the chords that inhabit it.
